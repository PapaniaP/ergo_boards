## Theme Customization

### Setup

To create the blog, I had to use WordPress and decided to utilize Elementor as the full site editor. Although visually appealing, I encountered issues due to the theme I selected, [Neve](https://themeisle.com/themes/neve/), which wasn't fully compatible with Elementor's features in the free version.

### Global Styles

To align the theme with my design, I adjusted the color scheme, typography, and layout. For example, I changed the background color to a dark gray and selected an off-white font color to enhance contrast. I also chose Neurona Font for page titles and headings to maintain brand identity, even if it posed legibility challenges.

### Improvements

I improved the visual appeal and layout by adjusting margins, enhancing readability. I implemented query loops to help users find content easily and provided links to relevant articles on the right side of the blog post. I also modified the header and footer to better suit the user's needs, simplifying navigation.

## Content Creation and Organization

Content creation and organization are vital for a successful blog. Engaging blog posts, structured logically, enhance the user experience. Effective organization through categories and tags makes navigation effortless.

### Content

I created original, informative blog posts with the assistance of AI. Covering various aspects of ergonomic and custom mechanical keyboards, these posts followed the blog's visual identity and featured relevant images, headings, and bullet points to enhance readability and navigation.

### Organization

I structured the blog with categorized content, grouping similar topics under specific categories or tags.

## UX and Interaction Design

### Comments

To personalize the user experience, I removed the comments section from my WordPress blog due to issues with spam and unrelated discussions. Instead, I implemented a newsletter subscription feature to establish a direct connection with my audience.

### Social Media

I planned to add social media sharing buttons to encourage readers to share content on their favorite platforms. However, this feature remains on my to-do list for future improvements.

### Responsive Design

I optimized the blog for mobile devices, embracing responsive design techniques. This ensures a seamless browsing experience on various screen sizes, catering to the growing number of mobile users.
